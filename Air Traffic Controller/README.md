# Air-Traffic-Controller

This Project aims at building a basic air-traffic-controller.This project consist of two different classes where airport is our base class and planes is our derived class.There are 11 different airports and are they are connected to few airports only i.e every airport is not necessarily connected to every other airport. A fixed weight is used between airports to set distance between the two. Each airport having an index and mapped to its name using maps.Flights cost is also mentioned and is directly proportional to distance.Thereby shortest path have the lowest ticket cost.

 - To know the shortest path between our source and destination.
 - To know the minimum ticket price we can get between two places considering shortest path.
 - Number of paths between 2 airports taking no stops into consideration.
 - Reserve and cancellation of seats.

This project helped us to gain in-depth knowledge about various data- structures and their use in real world applications like these.
